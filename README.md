# RCES_finalproject

For my final RCES project, I intend to do the following: 

(1) Visualize a database of local measurements of Holocene relative sea level (RSL) compiled by Nicole Khan from published sources, a portion of which was published in 2015 [1]; 

(2) Visualize sea level predictions from ICE-6G, a coupled ice-earth model that includes glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA).  I will compare the ICE-6G output to sea level predictions from a hybrid model (ICE-Jonny) that combines ICE-6G with an unpublished ice sheet model from Jonny Kingslake and Torsten Albrecht simulating West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) re-advance in the late Holocene.  

(3) Compare local sea level measurements from Khan's database to ICE-6G & ICE-Jonny sea level predictions 

These visualizations will answer the following scientific questions:  

In what locations and by how much do the ICE-6G and ICE-Jonny sea level predictions differ?  In areas where ICE-Jonny predicts a late Holocene WAIS readvance, do local RSL measurements confirm these predictions?
